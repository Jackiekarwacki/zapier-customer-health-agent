## 🔧 Configuration

### Health Score Calculation
The system uses a sophisticated weighted algorithm:

```javascript
const overallHealthScore = Math.min(
  (zapUsageScore * 0.25) +           
  (platformAdoptionScore * 0.225) +  
  (appConnectionsScore * 0.20) +     
  (planUtilizationScore * 0.20) +    
  (onboardingProgressScore * 0.20) + 
  (supportHealthScore * 0.125), 
  100
);
```

### Risk Categories
- **Healthy** (70-100): Low churn risk, upsell opportunities
- **At Risk** (40-69): Medium churn risk, requires attention
- **Critical** (0-39): High churn risk, immediate intervention needed
